# Voice-Text-Chatbot-with-Ollama-Integration-
This Python script lets you chat with a local Ollama LLaMA3.2:1B model using voice or text. It uses `speech_recognition` for capturing voice input and `pyttsx3` for speaking responses. Chat history is preserved for context. You can switch between voice and text modes, making it ideal for an offline AI assistant.
